depth-profile-video-processing
==============================

Video processing tools for analyzing the depth profiles from Line Islands (and other coral reefs?) transects

These are some tools written (mainly in Python) to process video files created during the 2013 Line Islands Research Expedition. The code was mostly written by Rob Edwards, and much of it was written while at sea without internet access.

Please feel free to use this code as you wish, and to send Rob improvements or suggestions for enhancements.

Most of the code is written in Python and is not optimized for speed.
